# ecartebleue-cli

Command-line interface for VISA e-Carte Bleue service.

# Usage

`./generate.sh [user] [password]`

# Notes

Uses Docker to have a clean `casperjs` installation that can be painful to install on some systems (including mine).

# TODO

[ ] Handle 3DS if possible (or fallback at least)
[ ] JSON output option for programatic use
